#SOD Killer

SOD Killer (Sleep of Death) is an Android application that is design to try and eradicate a common issue with some Android device where the device fails to wake up when a user tries to unlock the device.

This application was made for my own use to fix this issue on the LG Nexus 4. I have also made the code available here.

You may download the application on the play store at the following URL.

You can also build the application.
