        App is designed to fixed the SOD (Sleep of Death) issue that has plagued the Nexus 4.
        This is an app for my own use, however it might be useful for other users who are Nexus 4
        owners or owners of other devices that has the sleep of death problem.
        <br /><br />
        To enable, just click on the button above. This will create a wake lock and will not allow
        your device to sleep. This is I feel the root cause of the SOD issue.
        <br /><br /><strong>Permission</strong><br />
        Run at startup - So if you restart the phone and you have allowed the app to keep the
        wakelock, the program will keep a wakelock.
        <br /><br />
        Prevent phone from sleeping - We are keeping a wakelock, so this is obvious....
